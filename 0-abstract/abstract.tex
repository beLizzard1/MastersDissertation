The goals of this project were to perform a Monte Carlo simulation of the Potts Model, to numerically generate the Density of States of a periodic and twisted lattice and investigate the behaviour of the interfaces that occur when a twist is introduced to the system, for a variety of Q states.
These goals have been accomplished using a variety of techniques, including using both the Metropolis update algorithm and the Wang-Landau restricted sampling technique in a custom lattice solver written in C++.
