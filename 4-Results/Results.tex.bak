\chapter{Results}
From the earlier chapter I described the final form of the data output from the program.
Below is a sample from the Metropolis data file.
\begin{table}[h]

\begin{tabular}{ccc}
0    & 0             & 0.000277831 \\

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The Wang Landau output file looks like this
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{cc}
-1.972222222   & 117.227  \\
-1.916666667   & 114.667  \\

-0.1388888889  & -28.7273 \\
-0.08333333333 & -26.1667 \\
-0.02777777778 & -28.7273
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Using this data we can start constructing the physical quantities and plotting them.

\section{Metropolis}
\subsection{Range of beta}
For the Metropolis data, the first step is to plot the data to ensure the program produced expected behaviour.
In this case expected behaviour for the Energy as a function of $\beta$ is that at low $\beta$, high T, the energy would be nearing it's maximum and that for high $\beta$, low T the energy would be close to its minimum and at there would need to be a transition between these two points.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{4-Results/Q10EnergyBeta16x16RangeofBeta.png}
\caption{Graph showing Energy vs $\beta$}
\end{figure}

In the graph above, the expected behaviours are clearly visible. The data shows that the energy approaches it's maximum at low $\beta$ and it's minimum at high $\beta$. 
The above graph is set for $Q=10$ which has a phase transition at $\beta_c = \ln(1+\sqrt{Q}) \approx 1.426$ in the thermodynamic limit, while the graph clearly shows a transition it isn't at this $\beta_c$ but this is due to the finite size of the lattice used in this simulation.

For Magnetisation the expected behaviour is that for high $\beta$, low T, that magnetisation per unit volume would be equal to 1. At low $\beta$, high T, this property disappears and should approach a minimum. Again the expected behaviour is seen in the graph below. The phase transition occurs at around the same position as in the Energy case which is another quick check to make.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{4-Results/Q10MagnetisationBeta16x16RangeofBeta.png}
\caption{Graph showing Magnetisation vs $\beta$}
\end{figure}

For the other data files that are measured, which include the Specific Heat, C and the Magnetic Susceptibility,$(\chi)$ the behaviour should be 0 everywhere except at the phase transition as stated above, $\beta_c \approx 1.426$ in the thermodynamic limit.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{4-Results/Q10SpecificHeatBeta16x16RangeofBeta.png}
    \caption{Q10 Graph showing Specific Heat ($C$) vs $\beta$}
\end{subfigure}
\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{4-Results/Q10SusceptibilityBeta16x16RangeofBeta.png}
    \caption{Q10 Graph showing Magnetic Susceptibility ($\chi$) vs $\beta$}
\end{subfigure}
\end{figure}

The peaks in the two graphs above are obvious and fit with the expected results for the respective quantities.

While these quick checks are useful while debugging the code to ensure that the simulated behaviours are correct, on their own they don't provide enough information to verify the code is working correctly this will be dealt with in the next step.

\section{Wang Landau}

\subsection{Plotting the Output}
The first step of dealing with the Wang Landau output is, like the Metropolis, is to plot it.
This is to visually verify that the behaviour is as expected, in this case the iterative process for calculating $a_n$ leads to data that starts at an initial value $a_0$ and that will converge towards and oscillate around in a band of acceptable values.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{4-Results/An16x16Convergence.png}
\caption{Graph showing the $a_n$ convergence vs n}
\end{figure}
It is clear that in the above graph the behaviour is as expected.
The value of $a_n$ converges extremely quickly towards it's target value and oscillates slightly around its value.

\subsection{Are the results compatible with the Metropolis?}
In an earlier section, I stated that the information provided by the metropolis wasn't enough information to verify the code was working correctly.
The Metropolis part of the program was a stepping stone to the implementation of the Wang Landau algorithm that was the primary portion of this project.
That being said, you can verify the results returned by the Wang Landau mode of this project by using the energy values returned by the Metropolis code at the $\beta_c$ at the thermodynamic limit. 
$a_n$ should be roughly equivalent to the $\beta$ required to keep the system at the target energy using this information and the value of $\beta_c$ I calculated the value of $a_n$ at the critical point using the energy value returned from the Metropolis data.
This leads to a data file looking similar to the one below.
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
8  & -1.74296 & 0.00591688 \\
10 & -1.72614 & 0.00648999 \\
12 & -1.71512 & 0.0058484  \\
14 & -1.69895 & 0.0067316  \\
16 & -1.71709 & 0.00491472 \\
18 & -1.7059  & 0.00541706 \\
20 & -1.72339 & 0.00435244 \\
22 & -1.69558 & 0.00478683 \\
24 & -1.71893 & 0.00365214 \\
26 & -1.71888 & 0.0039212  \\
28 & -1.7049  & 0.00379986 \\
30 & -1.7069  & 0.00395975 \\
32 & -1.72059 & 0.00357536
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
The first column is the lattice size, the $2^{nd}$ column is the Energy at $\beta_c$ and the third column is the error in the $2^{nd}$ column.
Using this data I wrote several shell scripts that are designed to run the program in the Wang Landau mode using the target energy provided in the $2^{nd}$ column.
Taking the results from the Wang Landau mode of the program using the shell scripts described above to collect the values of $a_n$ for the various grid sizes you can plot them against the inverse volume.
At the thermodynamic limit, the inverse volume should be 0. If you fit the results with a linear function $y=ax+b$, it's intercept represents the value at the thermodynamic limit.
The intercepts for this particular test are shown in the table below.
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Q  & Theoretical & Result   & Error    \\ \hline
2  & 0.881373587 & 0.865616 & 0.03173  \\ \hline
3  & 1.005052539 & 0.996294 & 0.01123  \\ \hline
4  & 1.098612289 & 1.11538  & 0.002026 \\ \hline
8  & 1.342454046 & 1.34759  & 0.008933 \\ \hline
10 & 1.426062439 & 1.43679  & 0.0152   \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

A plot of the data as it appeared is now provided below.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{4-Results/Q2-Verification.png}
    \caption{Q2 $a_n = 0.881373 \pm 0.03173$}
\end{subfigure}
\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{4-Results/Q3-Verification.png}
    \caption{Q3 $a_n = 0.996294 \pm 0.01123$}
\end{subfigure}

\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{4-Results/Q4-Verification.png}
    \caption{Q4 $a_n = 1.11538 \pm 0.02026$}
\end{subfigure}

\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{4-Results/Q8-Verification.png}
    \caption{Q8 $a_n = 1.34759 \pm 0.008933$}
\end{subfigure}
\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{4-Results/Q10-Verification.png}
    \caption{Q10 $a_n = 1.43679 \pm 0.0152$}
\end{subfigure}
\end{figure}

The above graphs show that in the thermodynamic limit, the calculated values of $a_n$ agree with the $\beta_c$ which is a form of verification to the results from the Wang Landau.

\subsection{Calculating the Partition Function}
The next stage of the project, which is required to calculate the Partition Function, $Z$, is to generate values of $a_n$ at regular intervals between the minimum and maximum energies.
The regular intervals are determined by the energy band width. That means that the midpoints of these intervals for a small grid size for $Q=2$ would be as shown below.
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
Minimum & Maximum & Midpoint \\ \hline
-2      & -1.9375 & -1.96875 \\ \hline
-1.9375 & -1.875  & -1.90625 \\ \hline
-1.875  & -1.8125 & -1.84375 \\ \hline
...     & ...     & ...      \\ \hline
-0.25   & -0.1875 & -0.21875 \\ \hline
-0.1875 & -0.125  & -0.15625 \\ \hline
-0.125  & -0.0625 & -0.09375 \\ \hline
-0.0625 & 0.000   & -0.03125 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Running the Wang Landau mode of the program with the midpoint as the target energy and the target width as the grid size.

The output from the program for each midpoint when plotted against the energy leads to the plot below.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{4-Results/a_n.png}
\caption{Graph showing the plot of $a_n$ across the energy bands for various Q}
\end{figure}

This graph has issues with scaling due to the fact that the maximum energy is dependant on Q.
The maximum energy is dependant on Q because the number of configurations that can represent each energy increases with Q.
A rescaled graph shows a clearer picture for the different Q.

\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{4-Results/a_n-rescaled.png}
\caption{Graph showing the rescaled plot of $a_n$ across the energy bands for various Q}
\end{figure}

A comparing my results with a similar result from the paper by Guagnelli for Q=10 is shown below.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{4-Results/Q10-MyData.png}
    \caption{Q10 Graph showing the rescaled plot of $a_n$ across the energy bands from the program}
\end{subfigure}

    \caption{Q10 Graph showing the rescaled plot of $a_n$ across the energy bands from the Guagnelli paper\cite{Montroll1963}}
\end{subfigure}
\end{figure}

The primary discrepancies between the two results is likely to occur due to the difference in lattice sizes used to generate the results and some arbitrary scaling factors used in the simulation.
To calculate the partition function, $Z$, from this data I turned to the symbolic computational mathematics tool kit Mathematica.
