\begin{abstract}
 I would like to thank,
 My friends and family for keeping me going throughout this challenging project.
 My project supervisor, without him, I wouldn't have made it as far as I did.
 My peers inside the Masters physics group whose collective ethos and support has provided invaluable insights over the last few years.
