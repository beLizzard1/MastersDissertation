%Necessary theoretical background

The Potts Model, a lattice simulation typically performed on a regular euclidean grid.
In this model, the number of states per lattice site is given by $q$.
In the code that was written for this project, each lattice point is assigned a value $q={1,q}$.
The values that are assigned to the lattice can be visualised as an angle equally distributed in the space.
\begin{equation}
\theta_{n} = \frac{2\pi n}{q}
\end{equation}
Or to show it visually,

\section{Lattice}
Most lattice simulations try to measure thermodynamic quantities in the Thermodynamic limit.
The Thermodynamic limit can be written as
\begin{equation}
N \to \infty, V \to \infty, \frac{N}{V} = const
\end{equation}
In this limit, macroscopic thermodynamics apply.

For small lattice sizes which are reasonably easy to simulate, you will have to account for boundary effects.
For small grids, boundary effects can start to dominate the behaviour of the system, because of this, periodic boundary conditions are often implemented to remove the issue.
A 2D lattice with periodic boundary conditions can be visualised as a torus like in the diagram below.

\section{Hamiltonian}

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{H} = J_{c} \sum\limits_{<i,j>} \delta(s_{i},s_{j})
\end{equation}

Where $J_{c}$ is a coupling constant, the summation is over the nearest neighbours and a Kronecker delta function which equals one whenever $s_{i} == s_{j}$.

\section{Magnetisation}

For a $q=2$ (Ising) model, the magnetisation is simply the sum of the spin states.
Thinking about it in terms of angles, assuming the lattice is completely filled then opposite states will cancel out.

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{M} = \sum\limits_{i}^{N} s_{i}
\end{equation}

For more complex $q$ we must fully engage in the angle model to calculate magnetisation.
Because each of the states $1,q$ has an angle representation and we know that the Magnetisation is a real quantity it was simply the sum of the cosines of the angle.

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{M} = \sum\limits_{i}^{N} \cos{s_{i}}
\end{equation}

Onsagers Solution for Spontaneous magnetisation for the 2D Ising Model, (ie/$q=2$ Potts Model)\cite{Montroll1963}
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{M} = \left(1 - \left[\sinh{2\beta J}\right]^{-4}\right)^{\frac{1}{8}}
\end{equation}
With $J$ being coupling strength. For the majority of this project, it is reasonable to assume $J=1$ because it isn't being used to calculate thermodynamic quantities of real materials.


The existence of an analytical solution allows for direct comparison.
To confirm that a generalised $q$ state Potts Model simulation is working correct involves setting the parameters to $d=2 q=2$ and confirming the accuracy of the analytic solution.
