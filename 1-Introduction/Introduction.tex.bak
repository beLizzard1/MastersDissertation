%Give basic idea of the project and its content. Describe (and give references to) other relevant work in the literature.
In the field of Computational Physics, there is a large interest in lattice simulation.
One of the most simple models that still exhibits non trivial behaviour is the q-state Potts Model.
By Restricting the Potts model to 2 or 1 dimension(s) and the constraining the number of independent states,$q = 2$ you can determine the behaviour at high,low and critical temperatures analytically\cite{Montroll1963} this is known as the Ising Model.

This dissertation will be looking at directly determining the interface free energy as a ratio of the partition functions.
\begin{equation}
F_{I}(L) = -\log \frac{\tilde{Z}(L)}{Z(L)} + \log(L)
\end{equation}
From the interface free energy above we can calculate the interface tension $\sigma$.
\begin{equation}
\sigma = \lim_{L\to \infty} \frac{F_{I}(L)}{L^{D-1}}
\end{equation}

To reach the final goal of studying the interface tensions in the q-state Potts Model, there w
