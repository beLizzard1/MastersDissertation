\chapter{Introduction}
%Give basic idea of the project and its content. Describe (and give references to) other relevant work in the literature.
In the field of Computational Physics, there is a large interest in lattice simulation.
One of the most simple models that still exhibits non trivial behaviour is the q-state Potts Model.
By Restricting the Potts model to 2 dimensions and the number of independent states,$q = 2$ you can determine the behaviour at high,low and critical temperatures analytically \cite{Montroll1963}this is known as the Ising Model.
