\chapter{Introduction}
%Give basic idea of the project and its content. Describe (and give references to) other relevant work in the literature.
%The goals of this project were to perform a Monte Carlo simulation of the Potts Model, to numerically generate the Density of States of a periodic and twisted lattice and investigate the behaviour of the interfaces that occur when a twist is introduced to the system, for a variety of Q states.
%These goals have been accomplished using a variety of techniques. 
%Including using both the Metropolis update algorithm and the Wang-Landau restricted sampling technique in a custom lattice solver written in C++.

This project studies the behaviour of interfaces that occur when a twist is added to a discrete state lattice.
The Potts Model is used in this project as it provides a variable number of discrete states, the Hamiltonian can be written in the form
\begin{equation}
H = -J\sum_{(i,j)} \delta\left(s_i,s_j)
\end{equation}
In this project we ignore the introduction of an external magnetic field so the Hamiltonian remains in this form.
