\chapter{Introduction}
%Give basic idea of the project and its content. Describe (and give references to) other relevant work in the literature.
This project looks at the Order-Order interfaces in the Potts Model.
To do this, I needed to develop a computer model of the system.
The model was designed to do all of the tests required with a single executable paired with a parameters file.
The program can be initialized and run with various bash script files in series and to improve total run time can be run with a SPMD (Single Process Multiple Data) tool GNU Parallel\cite{Tange2011a} which allows me to run the same process with different parameters simultaneously.

\section{Computational Physics}
Computational physics is a branch of physics that models complex physical systems.
A field of research in this branch of physics is Lattice simulations.
Lattices are highly suited to computer simulation due to their discrete nature.
